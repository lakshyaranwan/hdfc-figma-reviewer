# HDFC Design Reviewer - Figma Plugin

A Figma plugin that analyzes your designs using AI - **no API key required!**

## Features

- **No API Key Needed** - Works directly with your Figma selection
- **AI-Powered Analysis** - Uses advanced AI to review your designs
- **Multiple Categories** - Consistency, UX, Accessibility, UI, Typography, UX Writing
- **Custom Prompts** - Write your own analysis criteria
- **Severity Indicators** - High, Medium, Low priority issues

## Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd figma-plugin
   npm install
   ```

2. **Compile TypeScript:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Load in Figma:**
   - Open Figma Desktop
   - Go to **Plugins** → **Development** → **Import plugin from manifest...**
   - Select the `manifest.json` file from this folder

## Usage

1. Open any Figma file
2. **Select a frame or component** you want to analyze
3. Run the plugin: **Plugins** → **Development** → **Design Analyzer**
4. Choose analysis categories or write a custom prompt
5. Click **✨ Analyze Design**
6. Review the AI-generated feedback

## How It Works

Unlike traditional Figma analysis tools, this plugin:
1. Extracts design data directly from your selection (colors, fonts, spacing, layout, etc.)
2. Sends the structured data to our AI backend
3. Returns professional design feedback

No Figma API key is needed because the plugin has direct access to the document!
